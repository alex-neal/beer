### Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV?

### If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?


### Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?

A quick way to answer this question is to visualize a correlation matrix of the four factors along with the overall score.

We see that taste has a stronger positive correlation with overall score than any of the other three factors. **Taste is therefore the most important factor in determining the overall quality of a beer, according to the data.** 


### If I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?
